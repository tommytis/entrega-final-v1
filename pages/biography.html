                <h2 class="titlebiography">Her Career</h2>
                <p>Susanne Aartun Sundfør in Urban East is a Norwegian singer-songwriter and 
                    record producer. Born and raised in Haugesund, Sundfør embarked on her musical 
                    career two years prior to the release of her self-titled debut studio album (2007), 
                    which reached number three on the Norwegian album chart. It was followed by Take One,
                    a live album consisting of songs from her debut. Sundfør was born in Haugesund on 19 
                    March 1986. She is the granddaughter of theologian and linguist Kjell Aartun. After 
                    attending a music high school, she began making music as a hobby. She stated she started 
                    playing music when she was six, saying: "I would go to these classes where we would just 
                    sing and play the tambourine".</p>

                    <p>Sundfør rose to fame in her homeland in 2005, when she toured Norway opening for English 
                    singer Tom McRae. In 2006, she joined Norwegian band Madrugada on tour, performing their 
                    song "Lift Me", a duet the band originally recorded in the studio with singer Ane Brun. 
                    In November, she released her debut single "Walls", which would climb to number three on 
                    the Norwegian singles chart. Her self-titled debut studio album was released in March 2007 
                    and peaked at number three on the Norwegian album chart.</p>

                        <p>Susanne Sundfør was followed by the 2008 live album Take One, consisting of acoustic versions 
                    of songs from her debut album. Sundfør considers it to be "kind of like a remix album. Like 
                    if you have an album of just remixes of an earlier record you made, that's how I see it. So 
                    I don't really see it as an album like the other ones. "That same year, Sundfør covered Bob 
                    Dylan's "Masters of War" at Store Studio, NRK. The following month, she was awarded Spellemannprisen 
                    for best female performance. She spurred nationwide debate when she accepted the award, stating her 
                    work represented her as an artist first, and a woman second, bringing into question whether the Norwegian 
                    Grammy board was acting archaically with such gender-specific awards.</p>

                    <h3 class="biographydown">2010 - 2011</h3>
                        <p>In 2010, her second studio album The Brothel was released to critical acclaim in Norway and ended up 
                    becoming the best-selling album of the year. The album saw a shift from the piano driven pop from 
                    previous releases towards a more ambitious and electronic sound. Sundfør described it as a "conceptual 
                    album with both quite acoustic and electronic soundscapes. "Dagbladet wrote that Sundfør was so good that 
                    other young Norwegian artists would start crying when hearing her—both because she is several leagues above 
                    them, but also because her music is so moving and beautiful. It was at this time that Sundfør decided to commit 
                    to music as a profession. In 2011, she provided vocals on the title track from Nils Petter Molvær's album Baboon 
                    Moon. She also released an instrumental album, A Night at Salle Pleyel. The album is a live recording of a specially 
                    commissioned piece for the Oslo Jazz Festival's 25th anniversary. Sundfør composed it solely of synthesizers with a 
                    team of four keyboardists chosen by her</p>

                        <p>In 2012, Sundfør released the critically acclaimed "White Foxes", which served as the lead single to her third studio 
                    album The Silicone Veil, which is also Sundfør's first album to be released in the UK. The album received highly positive 
                    reviews from music critics internationally, and was a commercial success in Norway, debuting at number one on the album chart. 
                    Later that year, her collaboration with Norwegian musician Morten Myklebust on the single "Away" was released. On 6 December, 
                    she released a collaboration with the Norwegian electronic duo Röyksopp, "Running to the Sea". Sundfør collaborated with French 
                    electronic band M83 on the soundtrack for the 2013 film Oblivion. The soundtrack was released on 9 April 2013 and features the 
                    title song "Oblivion" with Sundfør contributing the main vocals.[25] Later that month, Sundfør's back catalog was released for 
                    the first time in the United Kingdom to positive critical response.[26] The following month, Sundfør was featured on a single by 
                    Susanna alongside Siri Nilsen.[27] The song was recorded by the three in 2012 for the Oya Container during the Øyafestivalen in 
                    Oslo, and was released wor</p>

                        <p>In October 2014, "Fade Away" was released. It served as the lead single to her fourth studio album Ten Love Songs, released in 
                    February 2015. The album was Sundfør's international breakthrough, and became a commercial and critical success, debuting at 
                    number one on the Norwegian album chart and garnering critical praise from music critics, with many listing it as one of the best 
                    albums of 2015. On 6 June 2017, Sundfør announced her fifth studio album Music for People in Trouble would be released on 25 August 
                    2017 through Bella Union, although it was later delayed to 8 September due to "unforeseen circumstances". The first single from the 
                    new album "Undercover" was released on the same day of the announcement. That same day, it was also announced Sundfør would embark 
                    on a tour in support of the album. The second single "Mountaineers" featuring John Grant was released on 24 July.</p>
